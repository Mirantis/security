# PSIRT Turnaround Times

The Mirantis PSIRT aims to complete triage and
inform the reporter of severity and next steps within
48 hours of receiving a report.

Targets for remediation of a vulnerability are

| Severity | Remediation Target |
|----------|--------------------|
| Critical | Patch/mitigation within 48 hours |
| Medium/High | Patch/mitigation within 7 days |
| Low | Patch/mitigation for next scheduled maintenance release |

These are _internal targets for the PSIRT_ and do not constitute a Service Level Agreement or
a binding contract.
