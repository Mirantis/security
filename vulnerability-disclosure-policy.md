# Mirantis Vulnerability Disclosure Policy


# Receiving Security Information From Mirantis

Technical security information about our products and services is distributed through several channels.

* Mirantis distributes information to customers about security vulnerabilities via https://mirantis.com and https://github.com/Mirantis/security.
* Mirantis may issue release notes and security bulletins detailing security vulnerabilities, workarounds, remediations and any indicators of compromise to aid incident response teams.
* Mirantis may request a CVE number for a security vulnerability and reference it in the above
* Mirantis may coordinate with a regional CSERT in disseminating security information


# Reporting a Security Vulnerability to Mirantis

This vulnerability disclosure policy applies to any vulnerabilities you are considering reporting to Mirantis.

We recommend reading this vulnerability disclosure policy fully before you report a vulnerability and always acting in compliance with it.

We value those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities according to this policy. However, we do not offer monetary rewards for vulnerability disclosures.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability relating to the Mirantis’s [systems or products](#In-Scope), please submit a vulnerability report to psirt@mirantis.com.

In your report please include details of:

* The software package, website, IP or page where the vulnerability can be observed.

* A brief description of the type of vulnerability, for example; “XSS vulnerability”.

* Steps to reproduce. These should be a benign, non-destructive, proof of concept. This helps to ensure that the report can be triaged quickly and accurately. It also reduces the likelihood of duplicate reports, or malicious exploitation of some vulnerabilities, such as sub-domain takeovers.

## In Scope

* Mirantis Container Cloud
* Mirantis Kubernetes Engine
* Mirantis Secure Registry
* Mirantis Container Runtime
* Mirantis OpenStack for Kubernetes
* Lens and associated services
* K0s


## What to expect
After you have submitted your report, we will respond to your report within 72 hours and aim to triage your report within 5 working days. We’ll also aim to keep you informed of our progress.

Priority for remediation is assessed by looking at the impact, severity and exploit complexity. Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address. You are welcome to enquire on the status but should avoid doing so more than once every 14 days. This allows our teams to focus on the remediation.

We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.

Once your vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome requests to disclose your report. We’d like to unify our guidance, so please do continue to coordinate public release with us.

We will recognize your contribution to any vulnerability announcement or CVE. Anonymity will be respected if requested.


## Guidance
You must NOT:
* Break any applicable law or regulations.
* Access unnecessary, excessive or significant amounts of data.
* Modify data in the Mirantis's systems or services.
* Use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities.
* Attempt or report any form of denial of service, e.g. overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests.
* Disrupt the Mirantis's services or systems.
* Submit reports detailing non-exploitable vulnerabilities, or reports indicating that the services do not fully align with “best practice”, for example missing security headers.
* Submit reports detailing TLS configuration weaknesses, for example “weak” cipher suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support.
* Social engineer, ‘phish’ or physically attack the Mirantis's staff or infrastructure.
* Demand financial compensation in order to disclose any vulnerabilities.


You must:
* Always comply with data protection rules and must not violate the privacy of any data the Mirantis holds. You must not, for example, share, redistribute or fail to properly secure data retrieved from the systems or services.
* Securely delete all data retrieved during your research as soon as it is no longer required or within 1 month of the vulnerability being resolved, whichever occurs first (or as otherwise required by data protection law).

## Legalities
This policy is designed to be compatible with common vulnerability disclosure good practice. It does not give you permission to act in any manner that is inconsistent with the law, or which might cause the Mirantis or partner organisations to be in breach of any legal obligations.
