Several container breakouts due to internally leaked fds.

Consult the [upstream advisory][upstream] and [snyk][snyk.io] for details, mitigations, workarounds, and patches.
### Affected Products
Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR) <= 23.0.9
## Vulnerability Information
### CVE Identifier
[CVE-2024-21626][nvd.nist.gov]
### CVSSv3.1
8.6 (High) CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
### CWEs
CWE-403, CWE-668
### How to check if your environment is vulnerable
`runc` version is equal or lower (<=) than `1.1.11-rc1`
````
# docker version --format '{{range .Server.Components}}{{if eq .Name "runc"}}{{.Version}}{{end}}{{end}}'
1.1.11-rc1 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
````
## How to fix
Upgrade MCR packages to the fixed 23.0.9-1 version or newer
* `docker-ee*` packages to:
  - `23.0.9~4-0` for DEB package based OSes
  - `23.0.9-4` for RPM package based OSes
* `containerd.io` package to
  - `1.6.28~rc.1-2` for DEB package based OSes
  - `1.6.28-4.1.rc.1.1` for RPM package based OSes
* `Caution:` Restart of the `dockerd` service is `NOT` needed! 
#### DEB package based OSes
```
# sudo apt-get install docker-ee=5:23.0.9~4-0~<OS> docker-ee-cli=5:23.0.9~4-0~<OS> docker-ee-rootless-extras=5:23.0.9~4-0~<OS> containerd.io=1.6.28~rc.1-2*
```
Check `runc` version:
```
# docker version --format '{{range .Server.Components}}{{if eq .Name "runc"}}{{.Version}}{{end}}{{end}}'
1.1.11-rc1.m1 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
```
#### RPM package based OSes
```
# sudo yum install docker-ee-3:23.0.9-4.<OS>.<Arch> docker-ee-cli-1:23.0.9-4.<OS>.<Arch> docker-ee-rootless-extras-23.0.9-4.<OS>.<Arch> containerd.io-1.6.28-4.1.rc.1.1.<OS>.<Arch>
```
Check `runc` version:
```
# docker version --format '{{range .Server.Components}}{{if eq .Name "runc"}}{{.Version}}{{end}}{{end}}'
1.1.11-rc1.m1 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
```

For more details please read the [MCR official installation documentation][mcr.docs]

### MCR 20.10.x 
If you have MCR 20.10.12 (`containerd` 1.6 is used starting from 20.10.12) please upgrade `containerd.io` package to the fixed version:
#### DEB package based OSes
```
# sudo apt-get install containerd.io=1.6.28~rc.1-2*
```
#### RPM package based OSes
```
# sudo yum install containerd.io-1.6.28-4.1.rc.1.1.<OS>.<Arch>
```

### Offline deployment
1. Download packages from [official Mirantis repository][mcr.repos] according your OS and platform
2. Copy them to offline nodes (using USB Flash for example)
3. Install these packages on hosts and check `crun` version
#### DEB package based OSes
```
# sudo dpkg -i docker-ee_23.0.9~4-0~<OS>_<Arch>.deb docker-ee-cli_23.0.9~4-0~<OS>_<Arch>.deb docker-ee-rootless-extras_23.0.9~4-0~<OS>_<Arch>.deb containerd.io=1.6.28~rc.1-2_<Arch>
```
#### RPM package based OSes
```
# sudo rpm -i docker-ee-23.0.9-4.<OS>.<Arch>.rpm docker-ee-cli-23.0.9-4.<OS>.<Arch>.rpm docker-ee-rootless-extras-23.0.9-4.<OS>.<Arch>.rpm containerd.io-1.6.28-4.1.rc.1.1.<OS>.<Arch>.rpm
```
