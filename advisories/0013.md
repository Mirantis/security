### Mirantis Container Runtime and CVE-2024-41110: Not Vulnerable

#### Release Date
2024-07-23

#### Overview
In 2018-19, a security vulnerability pertaining to [Docker Engine Authorization Plugins][authz]
was fixed in Docker EE v19.03.0 and backported to Docker EE v18.09.1.
The patches were upstreamed to the open-source Moby project’s 18.09 release branch,
but the patches were not applied to the Moby development branch.
Consequently, Moby v19.03.0 and newer regressed – they are all vulnerable.
However, Mirantis Container Runtime never regressed:
the patches were carried forward into MCR v20.10 and v23.0.

#### Unaffected Products
No versions of MCR (Mirantis Container Runtime) are vulnerable to CVE-2024-41110.
Security scanners may incorrectly report MCR binaries as vulnerable
as they may be unable to distinguish MCR binaries which contain the fix
from binaries built from open-source Moby sources which are missing the patches.
