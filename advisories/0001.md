### Lack of websocket authentication in Lens causes remote code execution when visiting a malicious website
#### Release Date
2021/11/17

Linux users running Lens could be compromised by visiting a malicious website. The malicious website could make websocket connections from the victim's browser to Lens and so operate the local terminal feature. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the Lens user.

To exploit

1. Lens needs to be running on Linux
2. The attacker needs to know the cluster ID of at least one of the victim's clusters
3. The victim needs to visit a malicious site
